<div style="position:absolute; top:0, left:0;"><h3><q>Tall, sandy blonde, with sort of blue eyes, skinny in places, fat in others. An average gal. - Uma Thurman, self description.</q>
<q>I'm very happy at home. I love to just hang out with my daughter, I love to work in my garden. I'm not a gaping hole of need.</q>
<q>It is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet.</q>
<q>I was not particularly bright, I wasn't very athletic, I was a little too tall, odd, funny looking, I was just really weird as a kid.</q>
<q>Desperation is the perfume of the young actor. It's so satisfying to have gotten rid of it. If you keep smelling it, it can drive you crazy. In this business a lot of people go nuts, go eccentric, even end up dead from it. Not my plan.</q>
<q>My washing machine overwhelms me with its options and its sophistication.<q>
<q>Everyone looked the same, everyone had it down to such a perfect T. You get bored. That's when you have to say, 'I will be worst-dressed.'", on her questionable choice of Oscar attire this year (2004).</q>
<q>I had to go to a mirror and look at it. I couldn't picture myself in my own head. I had no image beyond a stick figure. I wasn't a mean person as a kid, or dumb, and something has to be said to justify excluding you.</q>
<q>Before I had my child, I thought I knew all the boundaries of myself, that I understood the limits of my heart. It's extraordinary to have all those limits thrown out, to realize your love is inexhaustible.</q>
<q>I think we all exude essential truths about ourselves, and then, as an actress, there's what you do with it. There's your wit and your imagination, and what you can cook up from your experience and understanding of what makes a human being tick.</q>
<q>In show business, to pry open doors in new areas is really tough. Until you have a successful comedy, people don't think you could be funny, which is what makes a director like Quentin Tarantino so special. He sees beyond the things on the resume that you've done to date and opens up wonderful cans of worms for you to crawl into. That's a cool thing.</q>
<q>Having children flips the game from being about you to being about what you can create in a home and what your responsibilities are. I've thought about quitting, but I love what I do so much - it's the big conundrum of my life.... So I'm fighting to keep my foot in the business, be creative and stimulated, and still take care of my children.</q>
<q>I've known some great rock chicks, and it seems to me they're allowed to have a lot more edge than movie people, where everybody's got the latest youth serums going, the newest exercise and, if that won't cover it, they'll do something else. There's this sort of improve-yourself aspect, whereas the music business seems to have this much more funky attitude, with, like, a slight respect for damage.</q>
<q>I've learned that every working mom is a superwoman.</q>
<q>By the time I was 27, when I had my daughter, I felt I had danced on every tabletop - which I hadn't. Now I know that I hadn't. At all. There are plenty of tabletops left, should I wish to dance on them.</q>
<q>Growing up in a small town in New England was one of the most aesthetically pleasant experiences that you can have.</q>
<q>It's a shakedown. But I feel grateful that the hard things have been survivable - I've been able to learn from them and grow - and that the things that have been like a gift, I've had the wherewithal to realize are a gift.</q>
<q>As they say in gambling, I've gotten to stay at the table. I've hung in! They pull the plug on people all the time. The sky hook comes out, and it's all over. But there are much bigger sky hooks - as well we know.</q>
<q>I think a lot of our lives we spend moving forward, leaping from rock to rock, trying to figure it out. But it's wonderful to feel in the prime of your life. I feel like I'm in the right place and in the right time with myself.</q>
<q>You learn that the first failure isn't the end. I thought I'd seen the end of my career 10 times over. I've experienced them as death blows. What's nice - after numerous efforts, successes, failures, losses, professional and personal - is to actually accept you're not going to ace your life. You suffer, then you get on with it. You may spend three months in bed, but, eventually, you're going to have to get up.</q>
<q>When I was a teenager people often referred to me as jaded or knowing. It's a classic teen illusion to think you know it all, but I've certainly learned I don't.</q>
<q>People shouldn't be defined by these early alliances in their lives.</q>
<q>As a kid I changed school so many times, I was never particularly integrated into any sort of social strata with other children. Plays were one of the few things that I felt a desire to participate in. On stage I didn't feel any inhibitions. Acting gave me a way to express myself.</q>
<q>Look, I wasn't discovered at McDonald's or Howard Johnson's. My background prepared me for life and gave me a fairly open, free-thinking attitude to life and this business we're in.
Common sense is highly underrated.</q>
<q>I've been doing this [acting] for years and years and years, and people say things nice and they say things mean, and it's just like, whatever. You take the good with the bad.</q>
<q>I'm enjoying getting older because I feel I didn't appreciate being pretty when I was younger. I felt terrible. When I was 10, someone told me I had an ugly smile, so I spent the whole of my younger years feeling embarrassed and never smiling with my mouth open. But what are you going to do?</q>
<q>I've never really found a niche - as they say in Hollywood - of, you know, an Uma Thurman movie. There is no "Uma Thurman movie" because I change so often.</q>
<q>Being an actress is not about yourself. It's about discovering other things and other people and other cultures. The richness that that has brought to my life and me as an individual is immeasurable.</q></h3></div>

<h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>

<p>She was born to Robert Thurman, a Buddhist writer and academic and Nena von Schlebrugge, a model. She is of mixed descent which explains her exotic looks.
She attended Amherst Regional Middle School. As a child she was an introvert as children made fun of her lanky frame and enormous feet.
She attended a Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Massachusetts. However, she dropped out when she was 15 to pursue an acting career.
Actress Uma Thurman was born on April 29, 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts. Named for a Hindu deity, Thurman made her film debut in Kiss Daddy Goodnight (1987), a low-budget thriller. Her first well-known role was as Venus in Terry Gilliams's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). Wearing only hair extensions in her brief performance as the Roman goddess of love, the alluring young actress went on to take a number of sexually charged roles over the next few years.
At age 18, she bared all in Dangerous Liasons (1988), a big-budget period piece starring John Malkovich and Glenn Close, and in 1989 she starred in Henry and June, the first film to be released with an NC-17 rating.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>She began modeling when she was just 15; she has appeared on the covers of ‘Glamour’ and ‘Vogue’. Thurman played the character of Cecile de Volanges in the 1988 historical drama ‘Dangerous Liaisons’. The movie was critically acclaimed and nominated for several Academy Awards.</p>

<p>She was cast as the main star, Sissy, in the 1994 movie ‘Even Cowgirls Get the Blues’ which was based on a novel of the same name by Tom Robbins. The movie was however a critical as well as commercial failure. She found her big break when she was selected to play Mia Wallace in the dark comedy ‘Pulp Fiction’ in 1994. The movie was a huge commercial as well as critical success and Thurman was much appreciated for her role.</p>

<p>Over the 1990s she starred in several movies like ‘Beautiful Girls’ (1996), ‘The Avengers’ (1998), and ‘Sweet and Lowdown’ (1999). She had a baby in 1998 and took a four-year break from major film roles to focus on her family. She played ‘The Bride’ in ‘Kill Bill: Volume 1’ (2003) in which she portrays a woman who seeks revenge on those who massacred members of her wedding party and also tried to kill her. She earned several awards and nominations for this role.
She reprised the role of ‘The Bride’ in the second volume of the movie, ‘Kill Bill: Volume 2’ in 2004. This movie too was a huge hit like its predecessor.</p>

<p>In 2008, she appeared along with Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Colin Firth and Sam Shepard in the romantic comedy ‘The Accidental Husband’. The movie was a big box office success.
Her more recent movies include ‘Ceremony’ (2010), ‘Smash’ (2012), and ‘Movie 43’ (2013).
Thurman took a more independent course and projects a little riskier, with Sweet and Lowdown (Sweet and melancholy, Chords and Disagreements or The Great Lover) that was a Woody Allen movie, Merchant / Ivory by Henry James, The Golden Bowl (2000) and Chelsea Walls (2001), directed by Ethan Hawke who was her husband at that time.</p>

<p>In 2003, Uma starred in the two-volume Quentin Tarantino epic Kill Bill as a vengeful assassin. The actress also starred with Ben Affleck, in Paycheck. A film adaptation of the science fiction short story “Pay,” written by Philip K. Dick. Directed by John Woo.</p>

<p>In 2005, in The Producers, Thurman ventured into musical comedy with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. With the film My super ex-girlfriend (2006), which turned out to be a commercial failure and very critical.</p>

<h2>Major Works</h2>

<p>She is best known for her role in the action-thriller film ‘Kill Bill’ which was released in two separate volumes. She was highly appreciated for taking on the completely deglamourized role of a former member of an assassination team.
Her role of an excitable woman who seeks romance in her life in the television movie ‘Hysterical Blindness’ is another one of her fine performances.</p>

<p>'Pulp Fiction'
After appearing in a number of marginally successful Hollywood movies, Thurman stepped off the beaten track to appear in Pulp Fiction (1994), the second movie by acclaimed independent director Quentin Tarantino. For her nuanced performance as a glamorous underworld moll, she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award.
Thurman capitalized on the popular success of Pulp Fiction by appearing in a series of big-budget productions, including Gattaca (1997), Batman and Robin (1997), Les Miserables (1998) and The Avengers (1998). Shen then embarked on a more "independent" tack, favoring a series of riskier projects that included Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown (1999), a Merchant/Ivory production of Henry James' The Golden Bowl (2000) and Chelsea Walls (2001), directed by then-husband Ethan Hawke.</p>

<p>'Kill Bill' and 'The Producers'
In 2003 and '04, Thurman starred in Tarantino's two-volume epic Kill Billas a vengeful sword slashing assassin. The actress also starred with Ben Affleck in the sci-fi thriller Paycheck. With 2005's The Producers, Thurman took on musical comedy with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
But her humor missed its mark with My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006), which proved to be a commercial and critical disappointment. Directed by Griffin Dunne, 2008's The Accidental Husband also explored love and revenge. It featured Thurman as a radio talk show host who convinces a woman to break up with her boyfriend.
In recent years, Thurman has taken on a variety of roles, from playing a mythic monster in Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief(2010) to a powerful Parisian woman in Bel Ami (2012), as one of Robert Patterson's love interests. She also had a recurring television role around this time, on the musical drama Smash, and later appeared in the culinary-themed drama Burnt (2015), with Bradley Cooper.</p>
