<div style="position:absolute; top:0, left:0;"><h3><q>Tall, sandy blonde, with sort of blue eyes, skinny in places, fat in others. An average gal. - Uma Thurman, self description.</q>
<q>I'm very happy at home. I love to just hang out with my daughter, I love to work in my garden. I'm not a gaping hole of need.</q>
<q>It is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet.</q>
<q>I was not particularly bright, I wasn't very athletic, I was a little too tall, odd, funny looking, I was just really weird as a kid.</q>
<q>Desperation is the perfume of the young actor. It's so satisfying to have gotten rid of it. If you keep smelling it, it can drive you crazy. In this business a lot of people go nuts, go eccentric, even end up dead from it. Not my plan.</q>
<q>My washing machine overwhelms me with its options and its sophistication.<q>
<q>Everyone looked the same, everyone had it down to such a perfect T. You get bored. That's when you have to say, 'I will be worst-dressed.'", on her questionable choice of Oscar attire this year (2004).</q>
<q>I had to go to a mirror and look at it. I couldn't picture myself in my own head. I had no image beyond a stick figure. I wasn't a mean person as a kid, or dumb, and something has to be said to justify excluding you.</q>
<q>Before I had my child, I thought I knew all the boundaries of myself, that I understood the limits of my heart. It's extraordinary to have all those limits thrown out, to realize your love is inexhaustible.</q>

<h1>Uma Thurman</h1>

<p>Born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1970, Uma Thurman was appearing in big screen features by the end of the following decade. She made a splash in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, earning a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination. After starring in The Avengers and Batman and Robin, she later garnered more attention for another collaboration with Tarantino, as a vengeful, sword-slashing assassin in the two-volume epic Kill Bill.</p>
